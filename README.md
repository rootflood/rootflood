##### I want you to know that I'm never leaving
##### 'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
##### you are my home for all of seasons
##### So Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
##### I love you forever where we'll have some fun
##### let's hit the North Pole and live happily
##### Please don't cry no tears now, it's Christmas baby
###### (song of sia: snowman)
